        <h1>Why Clickshame?</h1>
        <p>
          Nobody likes clickbait. It is a waste of time, it makes you feel tricked and decieved, and at its worst it can spread lies and false outrage across the internet, and even ruin lives. We created clickshame.com to start/continue the discussion about clickbait on the internet. This isnt the first time society has had a problem with yellow journalism, and it wont be the last. Clickshame is not meant to be a solution, but we hope that it will be a catalyst. A catalyst for innovation in the online media industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our hope is that new business models can be discovered and implemented that reward quality content over deception and cheap tricks for clicks.

          You can help by participating. You can also help by being careful about what you report as clickbait. Clickshame.com may turn out to be a waste of our time. But if you believe that there is power when we, as citizens of the internet, rally together for change, then let clickshame.com be a tool for that change.
